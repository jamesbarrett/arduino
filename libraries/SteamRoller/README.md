# SteamRoller

This exists to simplify the operation of a model steamroller of the sort made by Wilesco, where to achieve forward motion the steam valve needs to be opened and the direction of travel primed so that the valvegear will work before the gears are engaged. Obviously the library can't help with filling the water and fuelling, or any of the many safety constraints.

There is a dependency on the Servo library.
